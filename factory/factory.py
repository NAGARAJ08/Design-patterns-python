"""

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Factory Design Pattern is a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object. 
Instead of directly creating the object with new or __init__, you delegate that job to a factory (a function or class).

Simplest Example
Imagine you're at a pizza shop. You donâ€™t make the pizza yourself; you just tell the shopkeeper what type of pizza you want, and they make it for you.

In programming terms:

The factory is the pizza shop.
The products are different types of pizzas.
You, the customer, don't care how the pizza is made; you just want the right type of pizza.

# Other examples:
"""
lets take an example of e-commerce platform where customers can place orders for different types of shipping:

Standard Shipping
Takes 5-7 business days.

Express Shipping
Takes 1-2 business days.

International Shipping
Requires additional customs processing.

#  now if you want to add new type of shipping you can just add the same in the factory method and write the class for it

# without factory

    else:

# As we can see here, the client needs to know which specific class or function to call for a given shipping type.
# This leads to repetitive if-else conditions every time this logic is needed, making the code harder to maintain and extend.
